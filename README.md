# Priority-Preemptive-Round-Robin-Scheduler-
Implemented a Priority Preemptive Round Robin Scheduler in C, combining priority-based scheduling with time- slicing for efficient multitasking. Ensured higher-priority processes are executed first, while fairly distributing CPU time among processes with the same priority using the Round Robin approach.
